    c(person(given = "Jan-Philipp",
           family = "Quast",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "quast@imsb.biol.ethz.ch"),

Description: Useful functions and workflows for proteomics quality control and data analysis of both limited proteolysis mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) and regular bottom-up proteomics experiments. Data generated with search tools such as Spectronaut, MaxQuant and Proteome Discover can be easily used due to flexibility of functions.
